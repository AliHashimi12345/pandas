Why Use Pandas?
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

Relevant data is very important in data science.

What Can Pandas Do?

Makes a correlation between two or more columns
Finds average value
Max value
Min value
Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.

Read CSV Files
A simple way to store big data sets is to use CSV files (comma separated files).

CSV files contains plain text and is a well know format that can be read by everyone including Pandas.
